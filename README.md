### MyNote Capstone Project Overview

### **1. Project Introduction**

In the second semester of my third year, my team and I, comprising three members, developed a web application named "MyNote." Inspired by the success and versatility of Notion, which serves millions of users including employers and students, we envisioned creating a similar platform with enhanced functionalities tailored to our goals. Thus, "MyNote" was designed to be a powerful yet user-friendly productivity tool.
